# Introducing Gà Nấm Cake Shop.
The purpose of this website is to help people order products from our cake shop online, then we will deliver their orders as soon as possible.

# Website:
https://ganamcakeshop.onrender.com/

# Technologies used to build this website:
1. Front-end: <b>HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript</b>.
2. Back-end: <b>NodeJS and ExpressJS</b>
3. NoSQL Database: <b>MongoDB</b>
4. Cloud Database: <b>MongoDB Atlas</b>.
5. Hosting: <b>Render</b> (free).

Basically, hosting a website that people can access can't depend on an offline database. That's why our team uses MongoDB Atlas to let it connect to Render, so that the website can work perfectly.

# What's working?
Almost everything.

# Known Bugs:
1. Managers can't remove any member in Members section.
2. Both "Remember me" and "Forgot password?" in Login page haven't been implemented.
