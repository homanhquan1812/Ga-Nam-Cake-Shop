# Technologies used to build this website
1. Front-end: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript.
2. Back-end: NodeJS and ExpressJS
3. NoSQL Database: MongoDB.
4. Cloud Database: MongoDB Atlas.
5. Hosting: Render (free).

Basically, hosting a website that people can access can't rely on offline database. That's why we use MongoDB Atlas to let it connect to Render, so that the website can work perfectly.
